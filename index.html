        <h2>Bald Eagle</h2>
        <p>The bald eagle, with its striking white head and tail feathers contrasting against a dark brown body,
            is a majestic symbol of the United States.
            These powerful raptors are found near large bodies of open water, where they primarily feed on fish.
            Bald eagles have incredible eyesight, enabling them to spot prey from great distances. They build massive nests,
            often in tall trees, and mate for life.
            Historically, bald eagle populations faced significant decline due to habitat loss and pesticide use.
            However, through conservation efforts, their numbers have rebounded, and they are no longer considered an endangered species.

        <h2>Budgerigar</h2>
        <p>The budgerigar, also known as the "budgie," is a small, long-tailed parrot native to Australia.
            These social birds are popular pets worldwide due to their vibrant colors, playful personalities, and ability to mimic human speech.
            In the wild, budgies live in flocks and thrive in arid and semi-arid habitats. They feed primarily on seeds and grasses.
            Budgies are sexually dimorphic, meaning males and females can be distinguished by their cere color (the fleshy area above the beak).
            Male budgies typically have a blue cere, while females have a brown or crusty cere.

            Found throughout the Americas, these owls are highly adaptable, inhabiting diverse environments from forests to deserts.
            They are known for their deep hooting calls, which often echo through the night.

        <h2>Peregrine Falcon</h2>
        <p>The Peregrine falcon is renowned for its incredible speed, reaching over 200 miles per hour during its hunting dives, making it the fastest bird in the world.
            These powerful raptors have a distinctive black "moustache" marking on their face and are found on every continent except Antarctica.
            Peregrine falcons primarily prey on other birds, which they capture in mid-air with their powerful talons.
            They are highly adaptable, nesting on cliffs, buildings, and even bridges in urban areas.
            Like many birds of prey, Peregrine falcons were negatively impacted by pesticides, but populations have recovered significantly thanks to conservation efforts.

        <h2>Bee Humming Bird</h2>
        <p>Hummingbirds are a marvel of nature, renowned for their tiny size, vibrant colors, and incredible aerial acrobatics.
            These birds are unique in their ability to hover mid-air and even fly backwards, thanks to their rapid wing-beats (up to 80 times per second!).
            Hummingbirds are found exclusively in the Americas, with the greatest diversity in the tropics.
            They feed primarily on nectar from flowers, using their long, specialized tongues to reach deep into blossoms.
            This high-energy diet fuels their active lifestyle and rapid metabolism.
            Hummingbirds play a vital role in pollination, transferring pollen as they move from flower to flower.
