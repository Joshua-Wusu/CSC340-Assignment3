    <p>
      The bald eagle, a majestic symbol of freedom and power, holds a prominent place in American culture and history. Its striking appearance, with a snowy-white head and tail contrasting against a rich brown body, makes it instantly recognizable. But there's much more to this bird than its iconic looks.
    </p>

    <h3>Habitat and Range</h3>
    <p>
      Bald eagles are found throughout North America, from Alaska and Canada all the way down to northern Mexico. They prefer areas near large bodies of open water, such as coastlines, lakes, and rivers, where they can easily access their primary food source: fish.
    </p>

    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Size:</strong> With a wingspan reaching up to 7 feet, bald eagles are one of the largest raptors (birds of prey) in North America. Females are typically larger than males.</li>
      <li><strong>Plumage:</strong> Adult bald eagles have a distinctive white head and tail, which they develop around 4-5 years of age. Juveniles have mostly brown plumage with white mottling.</li>
      <li><strong>Eyesight:</strong> Bald eagles possess exceptional eyesight, with vision estimated to be 4-8 times sharper than human vision. This allows them to spot fish and other prey from soaring heights.</li>
      <li><strong>Talons and Beak:</strong> Their strong, sharp talons are perfectly adapted for seizing and carrying fish, while their powerful, hooked beaks are used for tearing into prey.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diet and Hunting</h3>
    <p>
      Fish make up the majority of a bald eagle's diet. They often snatch fish from the water's surface in a dramatic swoop, but they may also scavenge on carrion or steal prey from other birds.
    </p>

    <h3>Nesting and Reproduction</h3>
    <p>
      Bald eagles are known for their massive nests, which they build high in tall trees or on cliffs. These nests can be up to 10 feet wide and weigh over a ton! Pairs mate for life and typically lay 1-3 eggs per year.
    </p>

    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
    <p>
      Once endangered due to habitat loss and the harmful effects of pesticides like DDT, bald eagles have made a remarkable recovery thanks to conservation efforts. They were removed from the endangered species list in 2007 but are still protected under other laws.
    </p>

    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
    <p>
      The bald eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782. It symbolizes freedom, strength, and longevity, and its image appears on currency, official documents, and countless other symbols of American identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bald eagle is a truly remarkable bird, embodying power, grace, and resilience. Its story is one of conservation success and a reminder of the importance of protecting our natural heritage.
